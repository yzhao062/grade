"""Characterize agent graphs on a corpus with OBSERVABLE, multi-hop dependencies.

Who&When dependencies are inferred; tau-bench's are observed events but the
write->read edges are a one-hop model. SWE-agent is the corpus that can actually
answer the depth question: a coding agent opens files, searches, edits, re-opens,
and edits again, all as commands in the trace. So the dependency between a file
edit and the read it rested on is OBSERVED, and repeated read/edit cycles on one
file form genuine multi-hop chains. This is the test the other two corpora set up:
do real agent runs have deep dependency structure that would justify a heavier
graph model (PyG / message passing), or do they stay shallow?

Corpus: nebius/SWE-agent-trajectories (SWE-bench runs). Each row has a `trajectory`
(role system/ai/user; `text` holds the message), a `target` bool (issue resolved),
and a `generated_patch`. We parse each ai action command and the file it touches,
and model each file event as depending on the prior event on the same file -- the
observed per-file interaction chain. Its longest path is the observed dependency
depth.

Run:  python experiment/agent_graph_swe_agent.py
      (downloads one ~90MB shard once via huggingface_hub)
