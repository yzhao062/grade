"""Build and characterize two-layer graphs for the tau-bench corpus.

tau-bench is a tool-using agent acting against a backend database (retail / airline).
The DB read and write events appear in the trace, so the read/write structure is
observed rather than inferred (the write-to-read edges are a conservative model), and
some calls are consequential writes (book / cancel / modify a reservation or order)
whose correctness tau-bench scores with `db_match`.

This loader reports, per run:
  - the consequential subset: what fraction of steps mutate state
  - how many prior DB reads each write could have depended on
  - whether graph size / shape tracks failure (db_match)

Run:  python experiment/agent_graph_tau_bench.py
      (downloads a few model trajectory files once via huggingface_hub)
