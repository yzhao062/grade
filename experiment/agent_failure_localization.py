"""Second experiment: does the graph localize the fault, not just detect failure?

The keystone (agent_failure_detection.py) is run-level: does a run's graph predict that
it failed? This is step-level: given a failed run, which step is the fault? That is the
auditing question the unified view is meant to answer, not only "this run went wrong" but
"here is the decision it went wrong at."

Corpus: Who&When (the failure-only corpus the keystone had to skip), the labeled-failed
multi-agent runs, each with a human-verified ground-truth ``mistake_step``. Run-level
detection is inapplicable here (every run failed); step-level localization is exactly what
its labels support, so the corpus that could not anchor detection anchors auditing instead.

Ablation, mirroring the keystone's nested feature sets:
  - RANDOM   : a floor (rank the steps at random).
  - POSITION : one feature, normalized step position. The faults-are-early prior the
               characterization found (median fault position 0.33, 57% in the first third).
  - STRUCTURE: position plus graph-structural step features read from the typed graph: is
               the step's agent the most active, its activity share and rank, decision vs
               tool step, how far into the collaboration, and the agent's in/out handoff
               degree in the execution graph. STRUCTURE - POSITION isolates the localization
               signal the graph structure carries beyond "faults are early."

Honest scope: under the full-context dependency assumption these debate traces use, every
step depends on all prior steps, so the dependency layer is position-equivalent here and
carries no localization signal beyond POSITION. The structural lift therefore comes from the
EXECUTION layer (agent activity and handoff centrality), not the inferred dependency layer.
That a corpus with observed dependencies AND step-level fault labels does not yet exist is
the gap; on this corpus the claim is execution-structure localization beyond position.

Method: a pointwise ranker. A standardized logistic regression (liblinear, balanced class
weights; liblinear rather than the default lbfgs, which segfaults under this Windows conda
BLAS stack, and the two agree elsewhere) scores P(mistake | step features); steps are ranked
within a run by that score. Cross-validation is grouped by run (no step from a test run is
ever in training). Per-run metrics: top-1 (is the top-ranked step the fault?), top-3, and
MRR (1 / rank of the true fault). Reported as the mean over runs with a seed-block 95% CI
over 5 seeds. POSITION is a single monotone feature, so its ranking is identical across
seeds and its CI is zero by construction; the STRUCTURE - POSITION CI comes from STRUCTURE's
split-to-split variation.
