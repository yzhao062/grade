"""Characterize the graphs that real agent systems induce, to verify the graph is
a faithful representation of agentic systems and to motivate the system design.

Corpus: Who&When (ag2ai / Kevin355/Who_and_When, MIT), 184 real multi-agent
failure traces with step-level fault labels (mistake_agent, mistake_step). Each
task is a multi-expert collaboration with a Computer_terminal tool executor.

What this measures (each property settles a design decision, per
research/agent-graph-characterization.md):
  - size and shape  -> is the lightweight stack (NetworkX + PyOD) justified
  - dependency depth -> local scoring vs graph propagation / deep GNN (the PyG question)
  - failure origin   -> where faults start and how far they propagate
  - observed vs inferred -> what the trace gives for free vs what must be inferred

Run:  python experiment/agent_graph_characterization.py
      (downloads the corpus once via huggingface_hub if the cache is absent)
